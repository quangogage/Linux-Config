# Keyboard stuff
This directory contains some files relevant to configuring my keyboards.


## CIDOO ABM066-USB
As of writing I'm primarily using the CIDOO ABM066-USB keyboard. Included in here
are two important json files:

1. The keyboard draft definition json file required to configure the keyboard in the VIA application.
2. My saved layout file.

## AHK files
I use autohotkey for a couple different things (Have only used it on windows!)
Current ahk files:

1. Colemak layout script.
2. Custom focus window script 
    - I made this to easily switch to specific application windows while I'm working on windows.
    - I recommend combining this with actual keyboard macros so you don't have to press as many keys.
