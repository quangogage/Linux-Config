# Neovim Setup
This document will cover everything needed to get neovim configured how I like it!

I am also going to make note of anything I want to make sure I remember incase I have
to take a break for a while and may forget.

## Nvim Plugin Management
`:Lazy`  

## Important Keybinds
#### Coding
- `<CTRL-s>` - Fuzzy find in current directory.
- `<CTRL-j>` - Autocomplete github copilot
- `:Tabularize/{char}` - Line up highlighted code based on the char.
- `s{char}{char}` - Search with leap. Fast code navigation.  

#### General Navigation
- `<leader>h` - Open tab to the left.
- `<leader>l` - Open tab to the right.
- `<leader>b` - Open filesystem browser (neotree).
    - `z` - Collapse all.

#### Window Management
- `<CTRL-w>s/v` - Split window horizontally or vertically.
- `<CTR>-w>h/j/k/l` - Switch to window in one of the directions.
