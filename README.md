# Callgage Configuration
This directory is just so I can always be capable of setting things up with
my preferred configuration!

See [`LINUX-README.md`](LINUX-README.md) for Linux setup and keybinds.
Same with [`NEOVIM-README.md`](NEOVIM-README.md).

## Terminal
[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)

## Neovim GUI
I use [Neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide) off and on.

## Programming font
[IMWritingMono Nerd Font Mono]("[font]%20iMWriting") (Not sure why I am no unable to find this on the web, so I uploaded it to this repo).
